  Send build result to Gitee. It will be visible in the commit and/or pull request UI as appropriate. You must have at least one Gitee connection/server configured in the Jenkins global configuration. If you have more than one, select the appropriate one from the 'Gitee connection' dropdown menu in the job configuration.
